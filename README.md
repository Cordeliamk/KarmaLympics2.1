  <h1>KarmaLympic</h1>
  <p>An application that will let you host a scavenger hunt event. While your guests are busy solving challenges, the host can sit back and relax, approving the challenges in real time, while the application calculates the points for you. It will save the host a lot of time. Do you have guests that don't want to download apps or create accounts on their phone? no problem, this will be built solely on url access. Created because of a real case issue that happens every year in tears.

Watch a demo of the application here, to see what it features and how it will potentially look like:
